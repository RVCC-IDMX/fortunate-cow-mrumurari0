---

## Key interaction

Document one meaningful interaction where you learned something or had to adjust your approach.

**My prompt:**

> <!-- Copy the prompt you used -->
Help me add a weekend vs weekday feature to my fortune script.

**What happened:**

<!-- What did Agent do? What did you learn? -->
Copilot looked at what I had done with my code in fortune.js, and explained what it was going to change step-by-step before it changed anything. It showed me how to use new Date().getDay() to tell if it is a weekday, and then select fortunes.

## Context engineering

**What effect did you observe from changing the instruction(s) to `copilot-instructions.md?**

<!-- Did Copilot follow your instruction? How was the response different? -->
I added instructions in which I told Copilot to explain it's reasoning step by step before showing the code. Copilot's responses became more organized and easier to understand as a beginner.

## Reflection

Answer these questions thoughtfully. A few sentences each is fine.

**What stretched you?**

<!-- What felt challenging or pushed you outside your comfort zone? -->
I think adding the moods as a feature was new to me, but it was not challenging. I did get a little confused when I was trying to change the output based on different conditions. 

**What did you learn?**

<!-- What was the most useful thing you learned in this assignment? -->
I learned how (Math.random() × array length + Math.floor()) works, and how to use conditions to change the behavior of a program.

## Optional

**What do you want to explore further?**

<!-- Any features or concepts you're curious about? -->
I want to spend more time working with features, like time-based greetings. I'm also curious on how to take user input and build a response based on it. 

**Approximate time spent:**

<!-- e.g., 30 minutes, 1 hour -->
1 hour, 30 minutes.
